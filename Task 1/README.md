The objection of this task is to predict age of brain from IMF features. We first scale data with Interquartile range from 10th to 90th, as the range of different feature vary a lot and many later methods will be sensitive to the unit of feature. To fill missing value, we use KNN method, which fills NaN with the mean value of 5 nearest neighbors. Then, we use isolation forest to detect outliers. Though we also use other outlier detect method, but the final public score seems not that sensitive to this stage process. After above data preprocessing, we begin our feature selection. We do feature selection by recursive features elimination method to select 80 most salient features. This method recursively considers smaller and smaller sets of features by elimination some less important feature at every iteration. Finally, we use random forest regression to predict final response. To get a more robust result, we also divide the data into train part and validation part. The public score is ~68%.
